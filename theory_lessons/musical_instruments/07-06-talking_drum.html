                A talking drum is a West African drum that can mimic the tones and rhythms of human speech. 
                It has an hourglass shape with strings (tension cords) running between its two drumheads.

                The drum is played with a curved stick or the hand. When the player squeezes the cords under 
                the arm while striking the drum, the pitch changes, allowing the drum to “talk” — imitating 
                the tone, rhythm, and pitch of spoken language.

                The talking drum is used in traditional African music, ceremonies, storytelling, and communication between 
                villages. It was historically used to send messages before modern communication existed. In Nigeria, the 
                talking drum is known by different names — for example, “Dùndún” among the Yoruba people.
