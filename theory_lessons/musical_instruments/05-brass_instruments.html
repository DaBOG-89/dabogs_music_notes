    <h1>Brass Instruments</h1>
    <p>
        Brass instruments are a family of musical instruments that produce sound when the player 
        buzzes their lips into a cup-shaped mouthpiece. The vibration of the lips creates sound 
        waves that travel through the tubing of the instrument, and the pitch is changed by pressing 
        valves or moving a slide, as well as by tightening or loosening the lips.
        They are usually made of brass (a metal alloy of copper and zinc), though the defining feature is how 
        they produce sound, not the material.
