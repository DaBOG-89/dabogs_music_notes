               A euphonium is a brass wind instrument known for its warm, mellow, and smooth sound. 
               It looks like a small tuba and produces notes in a similar low range, but with a sweeter 
               and more lyrical tone. 
            </p>

               The euphonium is made of brass and has a wide conical bore (tube that gradually widens) 
               with a large flared bell. It’s played by buzzing the lips into a mouthpiece and pressing 
               three or four valves to change notes. Its sound is rich and blends beautifully with other 
               instruments.  
            </p>

                Made of brass with three or four valves. Has a conical bore and upward-facing bell. Produces 
                a deep, smooth, and singing tone. Often tuned in B♭.

                The euphonium is commonly used in brass bands, concert bands, and military bands. It often 
                plays melodic or solo parts because of its expressive tone, and it provides middle to low 
                harmony in ensembles.

                A euphonium player is called a <strong class="euphoniumist"><em>euphoniumist or euphonium player</em></strong>.
