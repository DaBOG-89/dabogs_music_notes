                A glockenspiel is a percussion instrument made up of metal bars arranged like a piano keyboard that produce 
                bright, bell-like tones when struck with hard mallets.

                Unlike the xylophone or marimba, which have wooden bars, the glockenspiel’s bars are made of steel or aluminum, 
                giving it a clear, sparkling sound. It is usually smaller and higher-pitched than other keyboard percussion 
                instruments. 
            </p>

                Metal bars arranged in a keyboard layout. Played with hard or plastic mallets. Produces a high, bright, bell-like 
                sound. Often portable or placed on a stand.

                The glockenspiel is used in orchestras, bands, marching music, and children’s music education. It adds brightness 
                and sparkle to the overall sound and is often used to imitate bells or magical effects.
