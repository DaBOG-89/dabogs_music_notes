                A tambourine is a small handheld percussion instrument that consists of a round wooden or plastic 
                frame with small metal jingles (called zills) attached around it.

                Some tambourines also have a drumhead stretched over one side, while others are headless (just the 
                frame and jingles). The player shakes, strikes, or taps it with their hand or fingers to make rhythmic 
                jingling sounds.

                The tambourine is used in orchestras, bands, gospel music, folk music, and dance performances. It adds rhythm, 
                sparkle, and accent to musical pieces.
