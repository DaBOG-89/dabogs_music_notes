                The dulcimer is a string instrument known for its soft and sweet sound. It comes in two main types â€” 
                the <strong class="mountain_dulcimer"><em><a href="">mountain dulcimer</a></em></strong>, which is plucked or 
                strummed on the lap, and the <strong class="hammered_dulcimer"><em><a href="">hammered dulcimer</a></em></strong>, 
                which is played by striking the strings with small hammers. Both are popular in folk and traditional music.

                 The mountain dulcimer has a narrow wooden body with three or four strings and a fretted fingerboard. 
                 The hammered dulcimer has a larger trapezoid shape with many strings stretched across bridges. 
                 Both produce a pleasant, ringing tone and are simple in design.

                The dulcimer is used in folk music, education, and therapy. The mountain type is common in Appalachian songs, 
                while the hammered type appears in classical and world music. It is also used in film music for its soft, 
                peaceful sound.

                The dulcimer plays a melodic, cultural, and emotional role in music. It helps preserve traditional styles, 
                brings people together at festivals, and promotes relaxation through its soothing tone.

                A dulcimer player is called a <strong class=""><em>dulcimerist.</em></strong>
