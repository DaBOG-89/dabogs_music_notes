    <h1>String Instruments</h1>
    <p>
        String instruments are musical instruments that produce sound by vibrating strings. 
        The vibration of the strings can be created in different ways — by plucking, striking, 
        or bowing them. The body of the instrument (often made of wood or other resonant material) 
        helps amplify the sound.

    <h3>Types of string instruments</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Plucked instruments – The strings are plucked with fingers or a pick.
                Examples: guitar, harp, banjo, kora. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Bowed instruments – The strings are played with a bow (a stick strung with horsehair).
                Examples: violin, viola, cello, double bass.
            </li>
            <li>
                Struck instruments – The strings are struck by hammers or similar mechanisms.
                Examples: piano, hammered dulcimer. 
            </li>     
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
 
    <ul>
        <li>
            Pitch: Changed by opening or closing holes with fingers or keys.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sound: Softer and more airy than brass instruments.
        </li>
        <li>
            Materials: Traditionally wood, but modern versions (like saxophones) can be brass or 
            other metals — they are still woodwinds because of the way they produce sound.
        </li>
    </ul>
