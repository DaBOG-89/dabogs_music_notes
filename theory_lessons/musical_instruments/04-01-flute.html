                A flute is a woodwind musical instrument that produces sound when air is blown across the edge of an 
                opening, rather than through a reed like a clarinet or saxophone. It’s one of the oldest instruments 
                in the world and is known for its clear, sweet, and airy tone.

                Modern flutes are usually made of metal (like silver or nickel), but older or traditional ones can be 
                made of wood, bamboo, or bone. The player, called a flautist or flutist, holds the flute sideways and 
                blows across the mouth hole while pressing keys to change the pitch.

                Flutes are used in many types of music — classical, folk, pop, and even African traditional music — 
                because of their soft, expressive sound and wide range.
