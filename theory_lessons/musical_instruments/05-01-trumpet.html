               A trumpet is a brass wind instrument known for its bright, powerful, and brilliant sound. 
               It’s one of the highest-pitched instruments in the brass family and is used in many styles 
               of music, from classical to jazz and pop.

                The trumpet is made of brass and has a long, coiled tube that ends in a flared bell. The

                tone. Notes are changed by pressing three valves and adjusting lip tension.
