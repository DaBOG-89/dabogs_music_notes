                A marimba is a percussion instrument similar to the xylophone, but it has larger wooden bars and 
                produces a deeper, warmer, and more mellow sound.

                The marimba consists of wooden bars (usually made of rosewood or synthetic materials) arranged like 
                a piano keyboard. Each bar is struck with soft mallets, and beneath each bar are metal or wooden resonator 
                tubes that help amplify the sound and add richness to the tone.

                Has wider and longer bars than a xylophone. Produces a rich, warm, and resonant tone. Often has 4 to 5 
                octaves of range.Played with two or four mallets.

                The marimba is used in orchestras, concert bands, solo performances, Latin music, and African traditional 
                music (where it originated). It adds both melody and rhythmic harmony to music.
