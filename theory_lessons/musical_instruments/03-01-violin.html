                A violin is a stringed musical instrument that is played with a bow. 
                It’s the smallest and highest-pitched instrument in the violin family, which also includes the viola, 
                cello, and double bass. 
            </p>

                The violin has four strings, usually tuned to G, D, A, and E. 
                The sound is produced by drawing a bow (a stick with horsehair stretched across it) across the strings 
                or by plucking them with the fingers.  
            </p>
                The sound is produced by the vibration of the strings, which resonates through the wooden body. Different 
                notes are created by pressing the strings at various points on the fingerboard.

                It’s used in many kinds of music — classical, jazz, folk, and even modern pop. 
                It’s made mostly of wood (spruce, maple, and ebony).
