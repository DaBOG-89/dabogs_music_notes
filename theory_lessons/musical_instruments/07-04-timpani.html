                A timpani (also called kettledrums) is a type of percussion instrument that consists of a large, 
                bowl-shaped drum made of copper or fiberglass, with a drumhead stretched over the top.

                Unlike ordinary drums, the timpani can produce specific musical pitches. The pitch is adjusted by 
                tightening or loosening the drumhead using a foot pedal or tuning screws. Timpani are usually played 
                in sets of two to four drums, each tuned to different notes.

                Timpani are mainly used in orchestras, concert bands, and film scores to add drama, rhythm, and 
                intensity to the music. They often emphasize rhythmic patterns or accent important musical moments.
