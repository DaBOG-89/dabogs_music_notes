                The kora is a traditional West African string instrument — a mix between a harp and a lute. 
                It has a beautiful, melodic sound that’s often described as gentle, flowing, and spiritual. 
                The kora is one of the most important instruments in West African music and storytelling traditions.

                 The kora has 21 strings, made from fishing line or traditional gut. Its body is made from a large 
                 calabash gourd (a hollowed-out fruit), covered with cow skin to form a soundboard. A long wooden 
                 neck goes through the calabash, and the strings are attached to tuning pegs at the top. It’s played 
                 while sitting, with the instrument held upright between the player’s legs.

                The player uses the thumbs and index fingers of both hands to pluck the strings. The rest of the fingers 
                hold two wooden handles on the sides of the instrument for support. The result is a soft, flowing melody 
                with interlocking rhythms that sound like two instruments playing at once.

                The kora comes mainly from countries like Mali, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea, and Burkina Faso. It’s 
                traditionally played by griots (jeli or jali) — musicians, poets, and storytellers who preserve history 
                through song. It’s used in ceremonies, storytelling, and praise singing.
