                A banjo is a stringed musical instrument with a round body, a long neck, and metal strings. It has a bright, 
                lively sound that’s often used in folk, country, bluegrass, and African-American traditional music.

                 The body (or pot) of a banjo looks like a drum, with a thin plastic or animal-skin membrane stretched over a 
                 circular frame. It usually has 4, 5, or 6 strings, depending on the style of music. The strings are stretched 
                 over a long neck with frets, similar to a guitar. It’s played by plucking or strumming the strings with the 
                 fingers or a pick.

                The banjo’s sound is bright, sharp, and rhythmic, giving songs a cheerful, bouncy feel. In bluegrass or country 
                music, it often plays fast, rolling patterns called “banjo rolls.” It’s also used in folk, jazz, African, and 
                Caribbean music traditions.
