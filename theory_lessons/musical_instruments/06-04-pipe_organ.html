                A pipe organ is a large keyboard instrument that produces sound by pushing air through metal or wooden pipes. 
                It’s one of the oldest and most powerful instruments, often found in churches, cathedrals, and concert halls.

                The pipe organ has one or more keyboards (called manuals) and a pedalboard played with the feet. Each key controls 
                a valve that sends air into a pipe, making it sound. Different sets of pipes, called ranks, create a wide variety 
                of tones — from soft flute-like sounds to thunderous blasts.

                Produces sound by air flowing through pipes. Controlled by keyboards and pedals. Has many stops that let the player 
                change tone and volume. Can imitate the sound of many instruments.

                The pipe organ is mainly used in church music, classical music, and ceremonial performances. It’s often used to 
                accompany choirs or to play powerful solo pieces that fill large spaces.
