    <h1>Elementary Classification of Musical Instruments</h1>
    <p>
        The elementary classification of musical instruments is the basic way of grouping instruments according to how they produce sound. 
        The most widely used system in schools and simple studies is the four main families:
    </p>
    
    <h3>1. String instruments</h3>
    <p>
        Sound is produced by vibrating strings.
        Played by plucking, bowing, or striking.
        Examples: violin, guitar, harp, piano (struck strings).
    </p>
       
    <h3>2. Wind instruments</h3>
    <p>
        Sound is produced by blowing air into or across the instrument.
        Divided into:
        Woodwinds (flute, clarinet, saxophone).
        Brass (trumpet, trombone, tuba).
    </p>
        
    <h3>3. Percussion instruments</h3>
    <p>
        Sound is produced by striking, shaking, or scraping.
        Two types:
        Pitched percussion (xylophone, timpani, marimba).
        Unpitched percussion (drums, cymbals, tambourine).
    </p>
        

    <h3>4. Keyboard instruments (sometimes grouped separately)</h3>
    <p>
       Played with keys, which control hammers or valves.
       Examples: piano, organ, accordion, harpsichord.
