                A trombone is a brass wind instrument known for its deep, rich, and powerful sound. 
                It’s unique among brass instruments because it uses a slide instead of valves to change 
                notes.

                The trombone is made of brass and has a long metal tube bent into an “S” shape. The player 
                blows air through a mouthpiece, and sound is produced by buzzing the lips. The slide is moved 
                in and out to change the length of the tube, which changes the pitch.

                Made of brass with a moveable slide (not valves). Produces a strong, bold, and resonant tone. 
                Has a wide pitch range and can glide smoothly between notes (glissando). Common types include 
                tenor trombone and bass trombone.

                The trombone is used in orchestras, jazz bands, brass bands, and military bands. It often plays 
                bass or harmony parts, but it can also perform powerful solos.
