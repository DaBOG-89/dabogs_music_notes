    <h1>Keyboard Instruments</h1>
    <p>
        Keyboard instruments are musical instruments that are played using a keyboard — a set of keys that the 
        performer presses with their fingers to produce sound. The keyboard allows the player to control pitch, 
        harmony, and sometimes dynamics.
    </p>

    <h2>Main types of keyboard instruments:</h2>
    <h3>1. String-based (older forms)</h3>
    <ul>

            Clavichord – Strings are struck by small metal tangents.
        </li>
        <li>
            Piano – Strings are struck by felt hammers when keys are pressed; allows soft and loud 
            playing depending on touch (hence its name pianoforte).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Wind-based (with pipes)</h3>
