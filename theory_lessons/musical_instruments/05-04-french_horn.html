                A French horn is a brass instrument known for its smooth, rich, and mellow tone. 
                It has a circular, coiled shape and is one of the most expressive instruments in 
                the brass family.

                The French horn is made of long brass tubing (about 12 to 13 feet when uncoiled) 
                wound into a circular shape with a large flared bell. The player blows through a 
                mouthpiece and changes notes by adjusting lip tension and pressing rotary valves. 
                The right hand is often placed inside the bell to help control tone and pitch.
