                A cello (short for violoncello) is a large string instrument that belongs to the violin family, 
                along with the violin, viola, and double bass. It’s known for its deep, rich, and warm sound — 
                similar to a human voice.

                 It has four strings, tuned to C–G–D–A, which are one octave lower than the viola’s strings. It’s 
                 much larger than both the violin and viola, so it’s played sitting down, with the instrument resting 
                 on the floor and supported by a metal rod called an endpin. The player moves a bow across the strings or 
                 plucks them with fingers to make sound.

                The cello has a deep, warm, and expressive tone — it can sound both powerful and emotional. In an orchestra, 
                the cello often plays the bass line or melodic solos. In chamber music, it provides balance between higher 
                and lower instruments. It’s also used in solo performances, film scores, and even modern pop music because of 
                its beautiful tone.

                The cello is an important part of orchestras, string quartets, and chamber music. It’s also used in jazz, 
                pop, and film music for its emotional sound.
