                A harpsichord is a keyboard instrument that was popular before the piano was invented. 
                It produces sound by plucking strings with small quills or plectra when the keys are pressed, 
                instead of striking them like a piano does.

                The harpsichord looks similar to a piano but is usually smaller and lighter. When a key is pressed, 
                a mechanism called a jack plucks a metal string, creating a bright, crisp sound. Unlike the piano, 
                the player cannot make notes louder or softer by pressing the keys harder.

                Has a keyboard and strings inside. Produces sound by plucking, not striking. Has a bright, metallic tone. 
                Often has two keyboards (manuals) and multiple sets of strings for different sounds.

                The harpsichord was widely used in Renaissance and Baroque music for both solo and accompaniment pieces. 
                It was often used to play basso continuo (chord support) in orchestras and chamber music.
