    <h1>Formal Classification of Musical Instruments</h1>
    <p>
        The formal (scientific) classification of musical instruments is usually done with the Hornbostelâ€“Sachs system. 
        This system is widely accepted by musicologists, and it groups instruments based on how they produce sound, 
        not on culture or tradition.
    </p>
    
    <h2>ðŸŽ¼ Formal Classification of Musical Instruments (Hornbostelâ€“Sachs)</h2>
    <h3>1. Idiophones</h3>
    <p>
        Instruments that produce sound from the vibration of their own body, without strings, membranes, or external air. <br>
        Examples: Xylophone, Cymbals, Triangle, Maracas, Gong, Castanets.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Membranophones</h3>
    <p>
        Instruments that produce sound through a stretched membrane (skin) that vibrates when struck, rubbed, or sung into. <br>
        Examples: Drums (snare drum, bass drum, talking drum, tabla, bongos, congas).
    </p>

    <h3>3. Chordophones</h3>
    <p>
        Instruments that produce sound from vibrating strings stretched between two points. <br>
        Examples: Violin, Guitar, Harp, Piano, Cello, Sitar, Kora.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Aerophones</h3>
    <p>
        Instruments that produce sound by vibrating air.
        Examples: Flute, Clarinet, Trumpet, Saxophone, Oboe, Pipe Organ, Horn.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Electrophones (added later)</h3>
    <p>
        Instruments that produce sound electronically or need electricity to amplify their sound.
        Examples: Synthesizer, Electric guitar, Drum machine, Digital keyboard, Theremin.
    </p>

    <h3>âœ… So in summary:</h3>
    <p>
        Idiophones â€“ Membranophones â€“ Chordophones â€“ Aerophones â€“ Electrophones
