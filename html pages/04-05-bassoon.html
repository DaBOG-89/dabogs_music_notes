                A bassoon is a large woodwind instrument with a deep, rich sound. It’s made of wood 
                (or sometimes metal or plastic) and plays some of the lowest notes in the woodwind family.

                The bassoon is a long, tube-shaped instrument that’s bent in half to make it easier to hold. 
                It has many keys and holes that the player presses to change the notes. The player blows air 
                through a small curved metal tube called a bocal, which connects to a double reed — that’s 
                what makes the sound.

                It uses a double reed, like the oboe. It has a wide range — it can play both low and high notes.
                It has a warm, deep, and expressive tone. Usually made from maple wood and finished with a 
                reddish-brown color.
            </p>
                The bassoon is mainly used in orchestras, bands, and chamber music. It often plays the bass line 
                in the woodwind section but can also perform solos because of its beautiful tone.

                A bassoon player is called a <strong class="bassoonist"><em><a href="">bassoonist</a></em></strong>.
