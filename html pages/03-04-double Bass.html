                The double bass (also called upright bass or contrabass) is the largest and lowest-pitched instrument in 
                the string family — bigger than the violin, viola, and cello.

                 It has four thick strings, usually tuned to E–A–D–G, one octave lower than the cello. Because it’s very large, 
                 musicians either stand or sit on a high stool to play it. Like the other string instruments, it’s played with a 
                 bow or by plucking (pizzicato) the strings.

                The double bass produces deep, powerful, and resonant tones — it forms the foundation of the orchestra’s sound. 
                In orchestras, it supports the cellos and brass with strong, low notes. In jazz, it’s often plucked (not bowed) to 
                create the rhythmic walking bass line. It’s also used in blues, rock, folk, and film music.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is essential in classical orchestras, jazz bands, blues, folk, and even reggae music. In jazz, it usually plays 
                rhythmic walking bass lines.

                A double bass player is called a <strong class="double_bassist"><em>bassist, Double bassist, Upright bassist or Contra bassist</em></strong>.
