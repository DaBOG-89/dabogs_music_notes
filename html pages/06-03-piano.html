                A piano is a keyboard instrument that produces sound by striking strings with small hammers when the keys are 
                pressed. It’s one of the most popular and versatile musical instruments in the world.

                The piano has a large wooden case containing metal strings and a keyboard with black and white keys. When a key 
                is pressed, a felt-covered hammer strikes the string, and when the key is released, a damper stops the sound. 
                The player can make notes loud or soft by pressing the keys harder or gently.

                Produces sound by hammering strings, not plucking. Has 88 keys (52 white and 36 black). Allows dynamic control — 
                soft, loud, and expressive playing. Comes in two main types: grand piano and upright piano.

                The piano is used in almost every style of music — classical, jazz, pop, blues, and gospel. It can play melody, 
                harmony, and rhythm at the same time, making it great for solo, accompaniment, and composition.
