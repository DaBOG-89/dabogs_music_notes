                An oboe is a woodwind instrument known for its clear, penetrating, and expressive sound. 
                It’s often used to play the melody in orchestras and bands because its tone easily stands 
                out.

                 The oboe is a slender, tube-shaped instrument made of wood (usually grenadilla or rosewood). 
                 It’s played by blowing air through a double reed, which vibrates to produce sound. The player 
                 changes notes by pressing keys that open and close small holes along the body.

                Uses a double reed (two thin pieces of cane tied together). Has a narrow conical bore that gives 
                it a bright, sweet sound. Usually made of dark wood with silver keys. Has a wide pitch range and 
                excellent control over tone.

                The oboe is commonly used in orchestras, chamber music, and film scores. It often plays melodic 
                and emotional parts, and in orchestras, it’s traditionally the instrument that gives the tuning 
                note before a performance.
