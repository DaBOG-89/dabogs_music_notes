                A drum kit (also called a drum set) is a collection of drums and cymbals arranged together so one person — 
                the drummer — can play them at the same time. It’s the main rhythm instrument in most modern bands like pop, 
                rock, jazz, and gospel groups.

                A typical drum kit includes several drums of different sizes and metal cymbals mounted on stands. The drummer 
                uses sticks, brushes, or foot pedals to play them, combining different parts to create rhythms and beats.

                Common parts of a drum kit include: Bass drum – the large drum played with a foot pedal. Snare drum – gives a sharp, 
                crisp sound. Tom-toms – medium-sized drums for fills and rolls. Hi-hat cymbals – two cymbals played with a foot pedal 
                and sticks. Crash and ride cymbals – for accents and steady rhythms. Can be acoustic (traditional) or electronic 
                (digital pads).

                The drum kit is used in nearly every modern music style — rock, pop, jazz, hip-hop, gospel, and funk. It provides 
                the beat and timing for the entire band, controlling the groove and energy of a song.
