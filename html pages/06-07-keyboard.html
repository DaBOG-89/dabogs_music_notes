                A keyboard is an electronic musical instrument that produces sound when you press its black and white keys. 
                It can imitate many instruments — such as piano, organ, guitar, strings, and drums — and often includes 
                built-in rhythms and sound effects.

                A keyboard looks like a piano but is fully electronic. It has keys, speakers, and a sound module that 
                generates tones digitally. Many keyboards also include buttons, sliders, and LCD screens to control sounds, 
                tempo, and effects.

                an acoustic piano.

                Keyboards are used in pop, gospel, jazz, electronic, and classical music. They are perfect for practice, 
                performance, and composition, offering a wide variety of sounds in one instrument.
