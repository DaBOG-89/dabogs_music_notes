                A cornet is a brass wind instrument that looks and sounds similar to a trumpet, 
                but it has a shorter and more compact shape and produces a softer, mellower tone.

                The cornet is made of brass and has three valves like the trumpet. Its tubing is 
                more conical (gradually widening), which gives it a warmer sound. Players produce 
                notes by buzzing their lips into the mouthpiece and pressing the valves to change 
                pitch.

               Made of brass with three piston valves. Has a conical bore, unlike the trumpet’s 
               cylindrical one. Produces a warm, mellow, and smooth tone. Commonly tuned in B♭.

                The cornet is often used in brass bands, military bands, and sometimes in orchestras 
                and jazz ensembles. It usually plays melodic parts and blends smoothly with other 
                brass instruments.

                A cornet player is called a <strong class="cornetist"><em>cornetist or cornet player</em></strong>.
