                A cymbal is a percussion instrument made of thin, round metal plates that produce a crashing or 
                shimmering sound when struck.

                Cymbals are usually made of brass or bronze and can be played in pairs (clashed together) or individually 
                with drumsticks or mallets. They come in different sizes, each creating a unique sound â€” from soft and 
                shimmering to loud and explosive.

               dramatic effects. There are different types, such as crash cymbals, ride cymbals, and hi-hats.
