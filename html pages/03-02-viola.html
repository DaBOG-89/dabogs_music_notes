                A viola is a stringed musical instrument that looks a lot like a violin, 
                but it’s slightly larger and has a deeper, richer sound. The viola is part of the violin family, 
                which includes: violin, viola, cello, and double bass. It’s held and played the same way as a violin — 
                under the chin with a bow.

                It has four strings, usually tuned to: C – G – D – A (one fifth lower than 
                the violin). The viola has a mellow, soulful tone — like a mix between the violin’s brightness and the
                cello’s warmth. In an orchestra, it usually plays harmony or inner melodies that support the violins and 
                cellos.

                The viola has a richer and darker tone compared to the bright, high-pitched sound of the violin. It often 
                plays harmony and inner melodies in an orchestra or ensemble.

                The viola is mainly used to fill the harmony, connect melodies, and add emotional richness to music — 
                it’s the bridge between the high sound of violins and the low sound of cellos. In solo music, it gives a deep, 
                emotional sound that many describe as human-like.
