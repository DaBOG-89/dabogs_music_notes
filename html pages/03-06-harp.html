                A harp is a large stringed musical instrument that has a triangular frame and many strings stretched vertically 
                across it. It’s one of the oldest instruments in the world, known for its soft, graceful, and heavenly sound.

                A harp has many strings — usually between 40 and 47 on a full-size concert harp. The strings are made of gut, nylon, 
                or metal, and each string produces a different note. The strings are plucked with the fingers, not with a bow. The 
                frame has three main parts: the soundboard, the neck, and the pillar.

                Types of Harps
            </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Concert (Pedal) Harp: The large harp used in orchestras. It has pedals at the bottom to change the pitch of 
                        the strings (like sharps and flats).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Celtic (Lever) Harp: Smaller and portable. Uses levers instead of pedals to change notes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Folk or African Harps: Found in different cultures, often smaller and played in traditional music.
                    </li>
                </ul> 
            
            <p>
                The harp’s sound is gentle, ringing, and dreamlike. It’s used in orchestras, folk music, solo performances, and religious 
                or ceremonial music. In an orchestra, the harp adds sparkle, beauty, and calmness to the music.
