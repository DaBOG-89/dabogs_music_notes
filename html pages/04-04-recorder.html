                A recorder is a woodwind musical instrument that produces sound when you blow air into it 
                and cover or uncover holes with your fingers to change the pitch.

                The recorder is a simple flute-like instrument made of wood or plastic. It has a mouthpiece 
                (called a fipple), a long body with finger holes, and a foot joint. Sound is made by blowing 
                gently into the mouthpiece and changing finger positions to play different notes.

                Usually has seven finger holes on the front and one thumb hole at the back. Comes in different 
                sizes â€” soprano, alto, tenor, and bass, each with different pitches. Known for its clear, sweet tone.
