                A guitar is a stringed musical instrument that is played by plucking or strumming its strings with the 
                fingers or a pick (plectrum). It’s one of the most popular instruments in the world — used in almost 
                every style of music, from classical to pop, rock, blues, and jazz.

                 The guitar usually has six strings, though some have seven or twelve. The strings are stretched over a 
                 long neck with metal frets, and across a wooden body that helps amplify the sound. Each string is tuned 
                 to a specific note (for a standard guitar): E – A – D – G – B – E (from lowest to highest).

                Acoustic Guitar – Has a hollow wooden body that naturally amplifies the sound. No electricity needed. 
                Electric Guitar – Uses magnetic pickups and must be connected to an amplifier to produce sound.
                Classical Guitar – Similar to an acoustic guitar but has nylon strings and a wider neck, used for classical 
                or fingerstyle music.

                The guitar can play melody, harmony, and rhythm, making it a very versatile instrument. It’s used for solo 
                performances, accompaniment, and in bands or orchestras. In modern music, it’s often the main rhythm or lead 
                instrument.
