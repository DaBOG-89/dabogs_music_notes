                A tuba is a large brass wind instrument that produces the lowest and deepest notes in the brass family. 
                It gives music a strong, full foundation and is often called the “bass of the brass section.”

               The tuba is made of brass and has a wide conical tube that curves around into a large flared bell. The 
               player blows air through a mouthpiece and presses valves to change notes. Because of its size, the tuba 
               produces a deep, rich, and resonant sound.

                The tuba is used in orchestras, concert bands, brass bands, and military bands. It often plays the bass 
                line, supporting the rhythm and harmony, but it can also perform solos in some pieces.
