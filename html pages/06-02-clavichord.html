                A clavichord is a keyboard instrument that produces sound by striking metal strings with small metal 
                blades called tangents when the keys are pressed. It was one of the earliest stringed keyboard instruments 
                and an ancestor of the modern piano.

                The clavichord is a small, rectangular instrument with a simple wooden case and metal strings stretched inside. 
                When a key is pressed, a tangent strikes the string and stays in contact with it, allowing the player to control 
                both volume and vibrato (a gentle wave in sound).

                Produces sound by striking strings with tangents. Has a soft, gentle, and intimate tone. Allows dynamic control 
                and vibrato, unlike the harpsichord. Usually has a single keyboard and a limited sound range.

                The clavichord was popular during the Baroque and Classical periods, mainly for practice and composing rather 
                than public performances because of its quiet sound. It was favored by musicians for its expressive control and 
                delicate tone.

                A clavichord player is called a <strong class="clavichordist"><em><a href="">clavichordist</a></em></strong>.
