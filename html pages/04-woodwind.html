    <h1>Woodwind Instruments</h1>
    <p>
        Woodwind instruments are a family of musical instruments that produce sound when air is blown through them, 
        causing a column of air inside to vibrate.
        They are called woodwinds because traditionally they were made of wood, though today many are made from metal, 
        plastic, or a mix.

    <h2>Types of Woodwind Instruments</h22>
    <h3>1. Flutes (air is blown across an opening)</h3>
    <p>No reed. Examples: flute, piccolo, panpipes, recorder. </p>

    <h3>2. Single-reed instruments (air vibrates a single reed attached to a mouthpiece)</h3>
    <p>Examples: clarinet, saxophone.</p>

    <h3>3. Double-reed instruments (air vibrates two reeds tied together)</h3>
    <p>Examples: oboe, bassoon, English horn.</p>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>

        </li>
        <li>
            Sound: Softer and more airy than brass instruments.
        </li>
        <li>
            Materials: Traditionally wood, but modern versions (like saxophones) can be brass or 
            other metals â€” they are still woodwinds because of the way they produce sound.
