                A piccolo is a small woodwind instrument that looks like a tiny flute. It plays the same way as 
                a flute but sounds one octave higher, giving it a bright, sharp, and piercing tone.

                The word piccolo means “small” in Italian, and it truly lives up to the name — it’s about half the 
                size of a regular flute. Piccolos are usually made of metal or wood and are played by flautists who 
                often switch between flute and piccolo in orchestras or bands.

                Because of its high pitch and clear sound, the piccolo is often used to add sparkle and brilliance 
                to the music, especially in marches, military bands, and orchestras.

                A piccolo player is called a <strong class="piccoloist"><em>piccoloist or flutist</em></strong>.
