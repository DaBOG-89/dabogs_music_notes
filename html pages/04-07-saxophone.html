                A saxophone is a woodwind instrument made of brass but played with a single reed like a clarinet. 
                It produces a strong, smooth, and expressive sound that’s used in many styles of music.

                The saxophone has a curved metal body with many keys that the player presses to change notes. It’s 
                played by blowing into a mouthpiece fitted with a reed, which vibrates to make sound. The 
                instrument’s wide, flaring bell helps project its tone.
