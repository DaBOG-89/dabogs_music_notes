                A digital piano is an electronic keyboard instrument designed to imitate the sound and feel of an acoustic piano. 
                It uses digital samples (recordings) of real piano sounds and often has weighted keys to simulate the touch of a 
                traditional piano.

                A digital piano looks like a regular piano or keyboard but produces sound electronically, not through strings and 
                hammers. When a key is pressed, the instrument plays a recorded piano tone through built-in speakers or headphones. 
                Some models include extra instrument sounds, like strings or organs.

                Uses digital technology to reproduce acoustic piano sounds. Often has weighted or touch-sensitive keys for a realistic 
                feel. Comes with volume control, headphone jacks, and MIDI/USB ports. Requires no tuning and is lightweight compared to 
                an acoustic piano.

                Digital pianos are popular for home practice, live performances, and recording. They are ideal for beginners, students, 
                and musicians who want piano sound with modern convenience.
