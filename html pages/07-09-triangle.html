                A triangle is a small metal percussion instrument shaped like a triangle, usually made from a steel 
                rod that is bent into a three-sided form with one corner left open. 
            </p>
            <p>    
                The triangle is suspended by a thin string or cord and played by striking it with a metal beater. 
                It produces a bright, ringing, and shimmering sound that can cut through the texture of an orchestra 
                or band.  
            </p>

                The triangle is used in orchestras, bands, folk music, and school music to add sparkle, rhythm, and accents. 
                Despite its simple appearance, it plays an important role in adding brightness to the overall sound.
