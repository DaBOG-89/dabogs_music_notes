                A panpipe (also called a pan flute) is a wind instrument made up of several pipes of 
                different lengths joined together. Each pipe produces a different note when you blow 
                across its top.

                 The panpipe is one of the oldest musical instruments in the world. It’s usually made 
                 from bamboo, wood, or reeds, and the pipes are arranged from shortest to longest — 
                 the shortest pipe makes the highest sound, and the longest pipe makes the lowest.

                It has multiple pipes of varying lengths. Each pipe plays one note. It doesn’t use reeds or keys.
                Produces a soft, airy, and sweet tone.

                The panpipe is used in folk music, especially in South America, Africa, and Asia. It’s also used 
                in modern music to create a peaceful or natural sound.
