                An English horn (also called a cor anglais) is a woodwind instrument that belongs to the oboe family. 
                It looks like a larger version of the oboe and produces a deeper, warmer, and more mellow sound.

                The English horn is made of wood and has a curved metal crook (a small tube) that holds the double 
                reed. Its body is longer than an oboe’s, and it ends with a pear-shaped bell that gives it its soft, 
                rich tone.

                It uses a double reed, just like the oboe. It’s larger and lower in pitch than the oboe. Has a curved 
                metal crook and a bulb-shaped bell. Produces a warm, expressive, and haunting sound.

                The English horn is used in orchestras, chamber music, and film music to add emotional or soulful tones. 
                It often plays melancholic solos or supports the oboe and clarinet in woodwind sections.
