                A xylophone is a percussion instrument made up of a series of wooden bars of different lengths that produce 
                musical notes when struck with mallets. Each bar gives a different pitch, and the bars are arranged like 
                a piano keyboard.

                The xylophone’s bars are usually made of hardwood such as rosewood or padauk and are mounted over resonator 
                tubes that amplify the sound. The player strikes the bars with rubber or wooden mallets, producing a bright, 
                cheerful tone.

                The xylophone is used in orchestras, bands, African traditional music, and school music education. It’s often 
                used for melodies, rhythm patterns, and colorful effects in musical pieces.
